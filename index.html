                 <p1><b>Diwali</b><br>Also known as the "festival of lights," Diwali is          a major  festival celebrated with the lighting of<br>diyas (oil lamps), fireworks, and the exchange<br>of sweets.

            When we spend Holi in Delhi, we bring out inflatable pools and pichkaris. All my cousins come to celebrate.<br>
            We love pranking our parents, so we set traps with water balloons and powder in the garden.<br><br></p2></div>
